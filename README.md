# IMDB-Data-Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the IMDB Movie Dataset using Python, aimed at extracting meaningful insights and patterns from a collection of over 1,000 movies. The dataset includes a variety of features such as movie titles, directors, genres, runtime, release year, ratings, votes, and box office revenue in millions. The analysis begins with an in-depth data exploration phase where the structure and quality of the dataset are examined. Key steps include identifying and handling missing values using heatmaps and summary statistics, removing duplicate entries, and understanding data types and memory usage. The cleaned dataset is then used to perform descriptive analytics that highlight essential aspects such as average movie runtimes, the most productive years in terms of movie releases, and summary statistics of numerical features like revenue and ratings.

Following the data preparation phase, the project moves into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using powerful visualization libraries such as seaborn and matplotlib. The analysis uncovers trends such as the years with the highest average votes and revenue, the top 10 longest movies, highest-rated films, and the most successful movies based on revenue. It also includes genre-level breakdowns, frequency analysis of different genres using Pythonâ€™s collections.Counter, and classification of movies into quality bands (Excellent, Good, Average) based on their ratings. The project further explores correlations, such as the relationship between rating and revenue, using scatter plots. By blending data wrangling, visual storytelling, and insightful statistical exploration, this project demonstrates practical skills in real-world data analysis and builds a strong foundation for applying data science in the entertainment industry.
