# IMDB-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the IMDB movie dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset contains information about movies including titles, genres, directors, release year, revenue, runtime, and ratings. The analysis begins with data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, detecting and removing duplicates, and understanding the structure of the dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is then conducted to derive insights such as the distribution of movies by year, top-rated and top-grossing films, average revenue and ratings by year, and identifying the most frequent movie genres.
Advanced insights include identifying correlations between ratings and revenue, classifying movies into categories like "Excellent", "Good", and "Average" based on their ratings, and breaking down genre distributions using frequency analysis. Visualizations like bar plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots are used throughout to help interpret the data. This project not only provides a deep understanding of the IMDB dataset but also strengthens data analysis and visualization skills in Python. Itâ€™s a great example of how real-world movie data can be leveraged for analytical storytelling.
